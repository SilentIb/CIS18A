# CIS18A Final Project V1

created by Alan Lai

Final Project for CIS18A, software used to document information in regards to an online resource, including essential browsing info such as potential risks involved when visiting a website as well as payment and copyright information.

Usage instruction:
Since there's no online implementation the most you can do right now is individual documentation on your own device. By entering 1 from the main menu you can fill out a short form which includes relevant documentation information for a website as well as your name. That will then be saved as a text document on your computer. Entering 2 from the main menu allows you to search for documentation on your device by entering the URL of a website. If there is documentation present on your device then the program will simply read it back to you. Entering 3 from the main menu will stop the program.
